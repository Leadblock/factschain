# FACTS Chain - Rebuild the Genuine and Reliable Internet Content Ecological System

Welcome to the FACTSChain source code repository!  FACTS Chain enables developers to create and deploy high-performance, horizontally scalable, blockchain infrastructure upon which decentralized applications can be built.

There is no public testnet running currently.

## Content Collaboration
FACTS introduces the idea of version, namely, users can perfect themselves and other's contents consecutively and record the new generated contents in the blockchain with a new version number.

## Content Directory Tree
In order to better structure and diversify the content, FACTS content is stored in multi-version and multi-version versions.

## FACTS Index
The current content and the quoted content are weighted according to the relevance of the relevance and rationality, combined with the degree of refinement of the content, proofs, user interaction, error correction, and other parameters. The fact index reflects the reliability and authenticity of the content to a large extent, providing a strong reference for users.

## FACTS Reference
In the Internet environment, the time cost for ordinary users to identify the genuineness of contents is growing more and more high. In the FACTS network, all contents shall be added with reference basis to ensure that the contents are well documented. It can guarantee the genuineness of contents by the content judging panel and the comprehensive action of content report, correction and other functions.
